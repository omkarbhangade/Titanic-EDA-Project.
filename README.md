# Titanic-EDA-Project.
Exploratory Data analysis of the Titanic disaster dataset

## project overview :
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, aiming to analyze and understand the factors that influenced the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. The dataset contains demographic and passenger information, such as age, gender, class, and fare, as well as whether they survived the disaster or not. Through data analysis and visualization, the goal was to uncover insights regarding the correlation between various features and survival rates.

## Dataset used :
- <a href="https://github.com/omkarbhangade/Titanic-EDA-Project./blob/main/Titanic.csv"> Titanic Dataset

## Requirements:
- Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and documentation.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.

## Major insights extracted:
1. Females were given higher priority in the rescue operation than male.
2. The first class people were given higher priority than the second class than the third class
3. The features such as Age, Siblings Onboard and Parents onboard didn't have major influence on the survival probability
4. A better way for filling the missing values for Age column is explained by extracting info from Name column

## Visualizations
This project includes the following visualizations:
- Bar charts showing survival rates by class, gender, and embarkation.
- Histograms to visualize the distribution of age and fare.
- Heatmaps to visualize correlations between numerical features.
- Pie charts for categorical data like the "Survived" and "Embarked" columns.

Please feel free to open queries for any sought of question regarding the EDA process follwed and open to suggestions.
